# GameMadeWithFriendsWIP
WIP. Don't even know what game it'll be yet. Most likely in Java, maybe some C# or JavaScript. Don't Judge. :P

Things we need to figure out:

<ul><li>
	What we are making? (pls don't be too hard)
</li><li>
	How do we want to do it?
</li><li>
	How good must it be?
</li><li>
	Who is interested in doing what? (I'm prob not gonna do anything visual)
</li></ul>

Maybe this will be fun?
